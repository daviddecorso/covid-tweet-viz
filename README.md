# COVID-19 US Twitter Data Visualization

This project aims to show which US states are tweeting the most about COVID-19 and whether the number of COVID-related tweets increases with the number of cases. State data is over a period of 20 days (7/25-8/13) and daily data is over a period of 19 days (7/26-8/13).

## Visualization:

These charts show which states are tweeting the most about COVID-19, which states have the most cases, and which states tweet the most for the amount of cases they have. The most tweets were sent from Washington, D.C. for the number of cases in the city. Vermont was the state that tweeted the most for the amount of cases they have. The amount of tweets sent from each state was related most closely to the state's population, although New York and California tweeted more per capita than other large states, like Texas and Florida.

These graphs show the amount of tweets per day plotted against the number of new cases per day to see if tweets correlated with new cases. There seems not to be any correlation between tweets and cases, even if the tweets are compared to the previous day's cases.

For further analysis I would like to compare weekly averages of tweets and cases over a longer period of time to see if a larger correlation is present. Unless an extremely large spike in cases occurs, I wouldn't think it likely for many more people to be tweeting about COVID than the day before due to case numbers. News stories from influential people or outlets are much more likely to have an effect on day-to-day numbers. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 tweets dataset used in this project only has tweets from July 15th and later making a longer-term averaged analysis impossible to carry out with this data.
